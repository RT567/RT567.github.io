            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Robert Thompson, I have made this site as a more casual way to explain a bit
                about myself. I studied Electrical Engineering at UTS because of my interest in building things,
                optimising, and its general versitility as a degree. Throughout my time at UTS I learned not only
                technical skills but also a lot about what motivates me and where I would like to take my career.</p>

            <p>Outside of University and work I mostly enjoy sports! A loose list from most interested to least
                interested (currently) is probably: rock climbing, futsal, skiing/snowboarding (time and money
                permitting haha), brazilian jiu jitsu, downhill skateboarding, hiking, cycling, surfing and more
                recently; kayaking and sailing!</p>


            <p>I used to also be quite an involved video game player, but I found it just took to much of my time. I am
                thankful for the good times I had with it though and all of the unironically excellent soft and hard
                skills I picked up along the way!</p>

            <p>My strengths are definitely more in big picture thinking and ideas generation. I enjoy coming up with
                creative solutions and thinking outside the box.</p>

            </br>

            <h3>Professional Skills</h3>
            <p>I have experience and skills with very high level programming (clojure/sclojuresctipt repl driven font
                end development) and lower level programming (assembly and C at University) and a lot in between (Python
                scripting, java/maven development).</p>

            <p>I am skilled at working with windows and linux (CLI too) machines as servers remotely and all the
                complications that come with that. I have solid skills with SQL and databases. I have solid skills with
                Nagios and other health and monitoring platforms. I am skilled in excel, the microsoft suite of products
                and their google counterparts. I know when to 3-bet from the big blind facing an open from the high-jack.</p>

            <p>I know git.</p>

            <p>I consider myself an excellent utiliser of generative AI (mostly GPT4 and Phind), I have been ahead of
                the curve with many of the these technologies and am able to handle them with a great deal of finesse
                and understanding to produce high quality work fast and without releasing company IP.</p>
            </br>

            <h3>Academic Experience and Projects</h3>
            <p>Worked with a team to model and and write three types of controllers to balance a Rotary Inverted Pendulum (Maths, MatLab, Control Theory, Arduino C).</p>
            <p></p>
            </br>

            <h3>Professional Experience and Projects</h3>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque vel justo non metus cursus pulvinar.</p>
            </br>

            <h3>Leadership Skills</h3>
            <p>I consider myself about 80% of the way up the leadership scale, with the average person at 50% on the
                scale this means that in a group of equally experienced peers if I have the highest "leadership score" I
                am likely to end up in a somewhat leadership postion. This also means that in a group of 8 people it is
                very likely that
                someone else will have a higher leadership score than me, under which circumstance I am more than happy
                for them
                to assume defacto leadership.</p>
            </br>

            <h3>Teamwork Skills</h3>
            <p>I love working in teams, the ability to not only bounce ideas but energy off other people is essential to
                not only creating something great, but enjoying the process along the way. </p>
