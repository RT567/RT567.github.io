                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hello! My name is Robert Thompson. I created this site as an easy way to share a bit about
                            myself. </p>
                        <p>I studied Electrical Engineering at UTS because of my interest in building things,
                            optimizing, and its general versatility as a degree. Throughout my time at UTS, I not only
                            acquired technical skills but also gained insight into what motivates me and where I'd like
                            to take my career.</p>
                        <p>Throughout my career, I hope to provide expertise in software development, IT/OT, electrical
                            engineering and electronics design to help and contribute to teams and projects I find
                            enthralling. I aim to contribute my little part to the wild world of modern technology and
                            have fun along the way. </p>
                        <p>My strengths lie in big-picture thinking and idea generation. I relish devising creative
                            solutions and thinking outside the box. I am able to quickly generate new approaches and
                            ideas without becoming too attached and heading in the wrong direction. I often find myself
                            more on the practical side than the theoretical.</p>
                        <p>Outside of university and work, I'm passionate about sports! A loose list, from my most to
                            least interested (currently), would be: rock climbing, futsal, skiing/snowboarding (time and
                            money permitting, haha), Brazilian jiu-jitsu, downhill skateboarding, hiking, cycling,
                            surfing, and more recently; kayaking and sailing! While I no doubt enjoy solving complex
                            technical problems, I also enjoy spending time reflecting and relaxing in nature.</p>

                        <h3>Professional Skills</h3>
                        <p>I have experience and skills in very high-level programming (clojure/clojurescript
                            repl-driven development) and lower-level programming (assembly and C at university), with a
                            lot in between (Python scripting, Java/Maven development).</p>
                        <p>I'm adept at working with Windows and Linux (including CLI) machines remotely, understanding
                            the complications that arise. I possess solid skills in SQL and databases, Nagios and other
                            health and monitoring platforms, networking, and hypervisors. I'm also proficient with
                            Excel, the Microsoft suite of products, and their Google counterparts. I know when to 3-bet
                            from the big blind when facing an open from the high-jack.</p>
                        <p>I know git.</p>
                        <p>I consider myself an expert user of generative AI, especially GPT-4 and Phind. I've been
                            ahead of the curve with many of these technologies, handling them with finesse and
                            understanding to produce high-quality work swiftly without compromising company IP.</p>
                        <p>I have experience with and enjoy working in teams, whether it be remote or in-office. I know
                            how to communicate professionally in a no-nonsense and concise manner without being overly
                            blunt. I understand how to talk shop but also create meaningful and enjoyable friendships
                            with people from all walks of life.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy learning new technologies. I am curious to learn their pros, cons, quirks, and design
                            principles. While I enjoy moving and learning fast I can also slow down and be details
                            oriented when necessary. </p>
                        <p>Excellent skills and experience in working with clients to refine project specifications to
                            an agreeable and achievable timeline. E.g. explaining the limitations on the flexibility of
                            JSON parsing to non technical stakeholders.</p>

                        <h3>Academic Experience and Projects</h3>
                        <p>Collaborated in a team to model and write three types of controllers to successfully balance
                            a Rotary Inverted Pendulum. I was responsible chiefly for the modelling of the system and
                            the design of the discrete time controller, which performed excellently. I learned a lot
                            about control theory and Matlab. (Maths, MatLab, Control Theory, Arduino C).</p>

                            and colours, simultaneous localisation and planning (SLAM), and path planning. We achieved a
                            28.5/30 in which we dropped a few points due to writing some slightly hacky and domain
                            specific code (which was considerably more efficient). (ROS, Python, computer vision,
                            pathfinding, and planning algorithms).</p>
                        <p>Successfully designed multiple digital and embedded systems; designing fully featured digital
                            alarm clocks from the ground up (from gates) and protocol compliant embedded systems on bare
                            bones microcontrollers (digital logic, Embedded C, various communication protocols, Quartus
                            Prime, Verilog/VHDL).</p>

                            simulations which determined the size and specifications of the distributed energy resouces
                            required in the town. We achieved a high distinction for our work.</p>
                        <p>Researched and designed machine learning models to classify rock climbing route difficulties
                            for my capstone research project. Using python based libraries pytorch, opencv and scikit
                            learn I created and compared various machine learning classification models for the task of
                            grading the difficulty of MoonBoard climbs, more information here. (image processing,

                        <h3>Leadership Skills</h3>
                        <p>When I am in leadership positions, I feel responsible for the performance
                            of the group as a whole and aim to allow every group member to contribute to their best
                            ability. This means creating an environment where people do not feel left out or left behind
                            and feel as though their opinions are truly heard. </p>
                        <p>In many University group assignments I
                            have assumed the role of ad-hoc leader, such as the previously discussed robotics group. I
                            stepped up to take the leadership role in the group, I fairly distributed work based on
                            skills and encouraged others with assistance and by putting
                            good work forward myself. I kept communication channels open and active as is necessary in
                            any successful group project.</p>
                        <p>With my leadership and excellent contributions from my fellow teammates we were able to
                            combine multiple pieces of code effetively to solve complicated computer vision and path
                            planning problems.</p>

                        <h3>Teamwork Skills</h3>
                        <p>I thrive in team settings. The opportunity to bounce ideas and energy off others is not only
                            essential for producing remarkable results but also makes the journey enjoyable. "If you
                            want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together."</p>
                        
                        <p>In the university group I was in for designing the control systems for the rotary inverted
                            pendulum, we had a very headstrong and intelligent group member who assumed the de-facto
                            leadership position. For some of our group members, they did not particularly like his
                            leadership style, and struggled to contribute meaningfully in the unfamiliar conditions. I
                            noticed their faltering commitment and positioned myself in between them and the de-facto
                            group leader. I was able to provide them with the communication and support they needed to
                            thrive while also translating their methods of communication to something our task-oriented
                            leader could understand.</p>
                        <p>Throughout my University career I have thoroughly enjoyed working in groups. On multiple
                            occasions I have had past group members reach out to me once they realised that I am also
                            enrolled in the same group based subject as them!</p>
