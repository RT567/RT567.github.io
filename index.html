            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Todo: make more obvious it isnt a canva or wix site: </p>

            <p>Hello! My name is Robert Thompson. I created this site as a more casual way to share a bit about myself.
                I studied Electrical Engineering at UTS because of my interest in building things, optimizing, and its
                general versatility as a degree. Throughout my time at UTS, I not only acquired technical skills but
                also gained insight into what motivates me and where I'd like to take my career.</p>

            <p>Outside of university and work, I'm passionate about sports! A loose list, from my most to least
                interested (currently), would be: rock climbing, futsal, skiing/snowboarding (time and money permitting,
                haha), Brazilian jiu-jitsu, downhill skateboarding, hiking, cycling, surfing, and more recently;
                kayaking and sailing!</p>

            <p>My strengths lie in big-picture thinking and idea generation. I relish devising creative solutions and
                thinking outside the box.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Professional Skills</h3>
            <p>I have experience and skills in very high-level programming (clojure/clojurescript repl-driven front-end
                development) and lower-level programming (assembly and C at university), with a lot in between (Python
                scripting, Java/Maven development).</p>

            <p>I'm adept at working with Windows and Linux (including CLI) machines remotely, understanding the
                complications that arise. I possess solid skills in SQL and databases, Nagios and other health and
                monitoring platforms, networking, and hypervisors. I'm also proficient with Excel, the Microsoft suite
                of products, and their Google counterparts. I know when to 3-bet from the big blind when facing an open
                from the high-jack.</p>

            <p>I know git.</p>

            <p>I consider myself an expert user of generative AI, especially GPT-4 and Phind. I've been ahead of the
                curve with many of these technologies, handling them with finesse and understanding to produce
                high-quality work swiftly without compromising company IP.</p>
            <br />

            <h3>Academic Experience and Projects</h3>
            <p>Collaborated with a team to model and write three types of controllers to balance a Rotary Inverted
                Pendulum (Maths, MatLab, Control Theory, Arduino C).</p>
            <p>Participated in a team project to plan and write software for various tasks related to navigating a small
                robot in a maze (ROS, Python, computer vision, pathfinding and planning algorithms).</p>
            <p>Designed multiple digital and embedded systems.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Professional Experience and Projects</h3>
            <p>Authored, tested, deployed, and monitored various software designed to gather and manage data from
                multiple pieces of infrastructure within the expanding smart electricity grid (Java, Maven, Git,
                Jenkins, Artifactory, Karaf, ActiveMQ, Linux).</p>
            <p>Set up comprehensive infrastructure monitoring platforms to ensure the stability of our production
                environment (NCPA, NagiosXI, Python).</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Leadership Skills</h3>
            <p>I consider myself about 80% up the leadership scale. Given the average person sits at 50% on this scale,
                it means that in a group of equally experienced peers, if I have the highest "leadership score", I'm
                likely to assume a leadership role. However, in a group of 8, someone else might score higher, in which
                case I'm more than happy to let them lead. ADJUST THIS, make it make more sense</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Teamwork Skills</h3>
            <p>I thrive in team settings. The opportunity to bounce ideas and energy off others is not only essential
                for producing remarkable results but also makes the journey enjoyable.</p>
