            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hello! My name is Robert Thompson. I created this site as a more casual way to share a bit about myself.
            </p>

            <p>Outside of university and work, I'm passionate about sports! A loose list, from my most to least
                interested (currently), would be: rock climbing, futsal, skiing/snowboarding (time and money permitting,
                haha), Brazilian jiu-jitsu, downhill skateboarding, hiking, cycling, surfing, and more recently;
                kayaking and sailing! While I no doubt enjoy solving complex technical problems, I also enjoy spending
                time reflecting and relaxing in nature.</p>

            <p>My strengths lie in big-picture thinking and idea generation. I relish devising creative solutions and
                thinking outside the box. I am able to quickly generate new approaches and ideas without becoming too
                attached and heading in the wrong direction. I often find myself more on the practical side than
                the theoretical.</p>

            <p>Throughout my career, I hope to provide expertise in software development, IT/OT, electrical engineering
                and electronics design to help and contribute to teams and projects I find enthralling. I aim to
                contribute my little part to the wild world of modern technology and have fun along the way.</p>

            <p>I studied Electrical Engineering at UTS because of my interest in building things, optimizing, and its
                general versatility as a degree. Throughout my time at UTS, I not only acquired technical skills but
                also gained insight into what motivates me and where I'd like to take my career.</p>
            <br />

            <h3>Professional Skills</h3>
            <p>I have experience and skills in very high-level programming (clojure/clojurescript repl-driven
                development) and lower-level programming (assembly and C at university), with a lot in between (Python
                scripting, Java/Maven development).</p>

            <p>I'm adept at working with Windows and Linux (including CLI) machines remotely, understanding the
                complications that arise. I possess solid skills in SQL and databases, Nagios and other health and
                monitoring platforms, networking, and hypervisors. I'm also proficient with Excel, the Microsoft suite
                of products, and their Google counterparts. I know when to 3-bet from the big blind when facing an open
                from the high-jack.</p>

            <p>I know git.</p>

            <p>I consider myself an expert user of generative AI, especially GPT-4 and Phind. I've been ahead of the
                curve with many of these technologies, handling them with finesse and understanding to produce
                high-quality work swiftly without compromising company IP.</p>

            <p>I have experience with and enjoy working in teams, whether it be remote or in-office. I know how to
                communicate professionally in a no-nonsense and concise manner without being overly blunt. I understand
                how to talk shop but also create meaningful and enjoyable friendships with people from all walks of
                life.</p>

            <p>I enjoy learning new technologies. I am curious to learn their pros, cons, quirks, and design principles.
                While I enjoy moving and learning fast I can also slow down and be details oriented when necessary.
            </p>

            <br />

            <h3>Academic Experience and Projects</h3>
            <p>Collaborated in a team to model and write three types of controllers to successfully balance a Rotary
                Inverted Pendulum (Maths, MatLab, Control Theory, Arduino C).</p>
            <p>Lead a team project to plan and write software for various tasks related to navigating a small
                robot in a maze. Using the Robot Operating System to handle detecting certain shapes and colours,
                simultaneous localisation and planning (SLAM), and path planning. (ROS, Python, computer vision,
                pathfinding, and planning algorithms).</p>
            <p>Successfully designed multiple digital and embedded systems; designing fully featured digital alarm
                clocks from the ground up (and gates) and protocol compliant embedded systems on bare bones
                microcontrollers (digital logic, Embedded C, various communication
                protocols, Quartus Prime, Verilog/VHDL).</p>
            <p>Worked in a group to successfully research, plan and design (not implement) a sustainable microgrid for a
                rural town within Australia. Researching various energy generation and storage solutions and modelling
                with MATLAB and Simulink.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Professional Experience and Projects</h3>
            <p>Authored, tested, deployed, and monitored various pieces of software designed to gather and manage data
                from multiple pieces of infrastructure within the expanding smart electricity grid. Achieved and
                received commendations from co-workers and clients alike (Java, Maven, Git,

            </p>
            <br />

            <h3>Leadership Skills</h3>
            <p>I consider myself about 80% up the leadership scale (my own theory). Given the average person sits at 50%
                on this scale, it means that in a group of equally experienced peers, if I have the highest "leadership
                score", I'm likely to assume a leadership role. However, in a group of 8, someone else might score
                higher, in which
                case I'm more than happy to let them lead.</p>
            <p>In my opinion, leadership should be viewed as a burden of service more than a position of elevated
                status.
                When I am in leadership positions, I feel responsible for the performance of the group as a whole and
                aim
                to allow every group member to contribute to their best ability. This means creating an environment
                where people do not feel left out or left behind and feel as though their opinions are truly heard.</p>
            <p>Due to this understanding that I have of leadership, it also means I am an excellent team member and
                contributor even when not in a leadership position. I understand the difficulties and responsibilities 
                and aim to provide succinct and meaningful information to my leader without overwhelming them with the
                details.</p>

            <br />

            <h3>Teamwork Skills</h3>
            <p>I thrive in team settings. The opportunity to bounce ideas and energy off others is not only essential
                for producing remarkable results but also makes the journey enjoyable. "If you want to go fast, go
                alone;
                if you want to go far, go together."</p>

            <p>I am a fair team member, understanding and never falling into any of the classic spiteful traps that
                can arise from communication breakdowns. I believe the first step to being a fair team member
                is being fair with oneself. I understand that some people are stronger in areas other than
                communication and teamwork (often highly technical individuals), and I aim to make their teamwork
                experience as easy
                and enjoyable as possible.</p>

            <p>By no means am I a smooth-talking CEO character, but I believe that I possess a valuable combination of
                technical and interpersonal skills that make me a valuable and enjoyable team member to work with.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Site Details</h3>
            <p>I created this site with plain css and html as a somewhat return to simplicity. Web1 style sites are a
                dying but elegant breed (yes, I like lisp
                languages, how could you tell... or maybe I have just spent too much time on hacker news). The site is
                hosted for free by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>.
